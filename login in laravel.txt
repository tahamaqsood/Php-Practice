Errors
Do you have two users logged in using the same browser? 
but Why would you allow a user to login twice in the same browser? 
if you don't care about security then just comment these two lines 
$request->session()->invalidate(); and 
$request->session()->regenerateToken(); 
in both log out functions (user and admin) 
 but I'll suggest you not to do this.
